# snnell v2.1
This is foremost an exercise in understanding. I am currently focusing on an implementation of NEAT, using this to evolve SNNs for a basic olfactory tracking task. The v2 design for the overall system is modular and includes some RL methods, but my distinct preference is for evolutionary methods. The RL methods are thus largely deprecated. For the next while I will be refining and modifying my NEAT implementation——including allowing for the mutation of neuron types (initially discrete within the Izhikevich models), extension towards modality-specific modular genomes, and STDP-based stochastic initialisation——then eventually moving on to HyperNEAT so that I can start to integrate the geometry of the embodiment-environment coupling into the evolutionary process.
