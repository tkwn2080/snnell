# snnell v2.0
This has been wholly rebuilt, with the same basic aim: teaching a false thing to smell. I have reduced my aspirations somewhat, starting now with standard artificial neural networks and working through reinforcement learning methods towards that aim. Currently I have implemented feedforward and recurrent neural networks, with the option of either q-learning, policy gradient, or actor-critic methods. The simulation itself is also much tidier now, and the whole is being built with an aim to be simple to use for testing a variety of setups.
